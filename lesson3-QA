Why do we use Derivative / Gredient to fit a target function?¶
Ans:因为难以通过固定的回合数获取目标函数，需要的是逐步渐进的不确定量级的计算过程

In the words 'Gredient Descent', what's the Gredient and what's the Descent?¶
Ans: 下降的是loss函数的值 ，梯度是步长变化

What's the advantages of the 3rd gradient descent method compared to the previous methods?
Ans:下降方向明确，下降快，不走弯路

Using the simple words to describe: What's the machine leanring.¶
Ans: 通过大量数据计算函数模型

Why do we need dynamic programming? What's the difference of dynamic programming and previous talked search problme?
动态规划以层扩展和计算，始终以当前点为初始点计算，简单；另一个课上讲的bfs和dfs，是需要要依赖之前点的连线，不断的向外扩散
bfs和dfs类似放射的线，从起点开始放射，扩散，而动态规划类似始终是多个线段相加，每次只计算线段，最终汇总即可
Why do we still need dynamic programming? Why not we train a machine learning to fit a function which could get the right answer based on inputs?

Can you catch up at least 3 problems which could solved by Dynamic Programming?
